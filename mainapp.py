        This application is a multi-language conversational chatbot built using **Streamlit** and **Gemini Pro (Google Generative AI)**. It allows users to upload PDFs, extract their contents, ask questions, and receive answers in **English**, **Hindi**, or **Marathi**.

        ### üß† Core Features
        - PDF upload and text extraction via `PyPDF2`
        - Multilingual support with automatic language detection and translation
        - Question-answering using `ConversationalRetrievalChain` and `FAISS` for semantic search
        - Sentiment analysis of responses using `TextBlob`
        - Audio playback of bot responses using `gTTS`
        - Session-based chat history

        ### üîÑ Tech Stack
        - `Streamlit` for frontend UI
        - `PyPDF2` for PDF reading
        - `Google Generative AI` via `langchain` for chat-based Q&A
        - `langdetect` for language detection
        - `gTTS` for text-to-speech
        - `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis
        - `FAISS` for fast vector-based search
        - `MongoDB` (optional) for backend storage (if enabled)

        ### üßæ How It Works
        1. Upload one or more PDFs using the UI.
        2. The app extracts text from each page and splits it into chunks.
        3. Chunks are embedded using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and stored in FAISS.
        4. You can ask questions based on the uploaded content.
        5. The response is translated into your preferred language (English, Hindi, Marathi).
        6. You can analyze the sentiment and even play the response as audio.

        ### üó£Ô∏è Languages Supported
        - English (`en`)
        - Hindi (`hi`)
        - Marathi (`mr`)

        ### üîà Audio Generation
        The last response can be converted to audio using `gTTS` and played directly in-browser. This helps visually impaired users or those who prefer listening.

        ### üß™ Optional Add-ons
        - Support for image-based PDFs via `pytesseract` (OCR)
        - User authentication and MongoDB-backed storage
